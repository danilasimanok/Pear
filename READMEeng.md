 Project contains several mini-games which you can play both solo and with your friends. No matter you like "The Gallows", "dont say the l word" or "EYC", Pear provides everything for your joy.

 
**dont say the l word:** 
 
 Having any troubles with launching Alias on your phone? It's not a problem anymore. Simple rules - 
 no words of the same root and the "letter" word, and only a single minute to explain to your friends what are you talking about. 
 You will be breaking your records of discovering new words within a single day.

**The Gallows:**
  
  Uhmm... You know what it is anyways.
 
**Evolve Your Creature:**
  
  Control your ward on his climb to the top! You will have to fight for each tiny piece of land and literally survive, because your
  enemies know no mercy.

**More soon. _Maybe_.**
